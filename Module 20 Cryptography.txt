E:\CEH-Tools\..CryptoForge  double-click SecretMessage.cfd -> Decrypt -> Passphrase: test@123 -> Ok 






e. Encrypt and Decrypt data using BCTextEncoder

PS: BCTextEncoder simplifies encoding and decoding text data. Plain text data are compressed, encrypted, and converted to text format, which can then be easily copied to the clipboard or saved as a text file. This utility software uses public key encryption methods and password-based encryption, as well as strong and approved symmetric and public key algorithms for data encryption.

Step 1: Encode Text  (.11)

E:\..BDTextEncoder  -> double-click BCTextEncoder.exe -> Insert or Paste Text -> Encode by: password -> Encode -> Password/Confirm: test@123 -> Ok 

Step 2: Decode Text

Clean the plain text -> Decode -> Password: test@123 -> Ok 







2. Create a self-signed certificate

PS: In cryptography and computer security, a self-signed certificate is an identity certificate signed by the same entity whose identity it verifies.



a. Create and use self-signed certificates

PS: In self-signed certificates, a user creates a pair of public and private keys using a certificate creation tool such as Adobe Acrobat Reader, Java’s keytool, Apple’s Keychain, etc. and signs the document with the public key. 

Step 1: Create Server Certificate (.19)

Check if the site includes certificate -> chrome -> https://www.goodshopping.com  (site can't be reached)

Search -> IIS -> Launch Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager -> (SERVER2019 (SERVER2019\Administrator)) -> double-click Server Certificates -> Create Self-Signed Certificate -> Name: GoodShopping -> Certificate Store: Personal -> Ok 

Step 2: Bind the Certificate to a Domain

Expand Sites -> GoodShopping -> Bindings -> Add -> Type: https -> Port: 443 -> IP: 10.10.1.19 -> Host name: www.goodshopping.com -> SSL Certificate: GoodShopping -> Ok -> Close -> Right-click the site (GoodShopping) -> Refresh

Step 3: Test the Certificate

Chrome -> https://www.goodshopping.com -> ADVANCED -> Proceed (unsafe)




3. Perform email encryption

a. Perform email encryption using RMail





4. Perform disk encryption

a. Perform disk encryption using VeraCrypt

PS: VeraCrypt is a software used for establishing and maintaining an on-the-fly-encrypted volume (data storage device).

PS: On-the-fly encryption means that data is automatically encrypted just before it is saved, and decrypted just after it is loaded, without any user intervention. 

PS: No data stored on an encrypted volume can be read (decrypted) without using the correct password/keyfile(s) or correct encryption keys. The entire file system is encrypted (e.g., file names, folder names, free space, metadata, etc.).


Step 1: Launch VeraCrypt and Create an Encrypted Volume

Search -> VeraCrypt -> Open -> Create Volume -> Check: Create an encrypted file container -> Next -> Volume Type: Leave default -> Next -> Volume Location: Select File -> Navigate to Desktop -> File Name: MyVolume -> Save -> Next -> Encryption Option: Leave Default -> Next -> Volume Size: 5MB -> Next -> Volume Password: password/confirm: qwerty@123 -> Next -> Filesystem: FAT -> Cluster: Default -> Check: Random Pool, Header Key, Master key -> (Move your mouse as randomly as possible within the Volume Creation Wizard window for at least 30 seconds) -> Format -> Ok -> Exit 

Step 2: Mount the Encrypted Volume

Veracrypt main Window (select a volume [I]) -> Select File -> Navigate to Desktop -> MyVolume -> Open -> Mount -> Password: qwerty@123 -> Ok 

Step 3: Test the Virtual Disk

Create a file on Desktop -> Test -> Type some texts -> save -> Copy and Paste in Local Disk (I) -> Close Window 

Step 4: Dismount Disk

Veracrypt -> Dismount -> Exit






b. Perform disk encryption using BitLocker Drive Encryption

Search -> Manage Bitlocker -> Open -> New Volume (E:) Bitlocker off -> Turn on Bitlocker (Under New Volume (E:)..) -> Check: Use a password to unlock the drive -> password/retype: test@123 -> Next -> Save to a file -> Save Bitlocker recovery key as :Location: This PC  Documents -> Save -> Encrypt entire drive..-> Next -> Compatible mode... -> Next -> Start Encrypting -> Close -> Restart

After restart

File Explorer -> This PC (Local Disk (E:) is encrypted -> double-click (put password) 

To turn it off
Control Panel -> System and security -> Bitlocker Drive Encryption -> New Volume (E:) Bitlocker on -> Turn off Bitlocker






c. Perform disk encryption using Rohos Disk Encryption

PS: Rohos Disk Encryption creates hidden and password-protected partitions on a computer or USB flash drive, and password protects/locks access to your Internet applications.

PS: It uses a NIST-approved AES encryption algorithm with a 256-bit encryption key length. Encryption is automatic and on-the-fly.

Step 1: Install Rohos Disk Encryption

E:\CEH-Tools\..\Rohos Disk Enc..  double-click rohos.exe -> Ok -> Next -> Finish

Step 2: Create New Disk

Create new disk -> Change -> Disk Size: 10Mb, File Type: NTFS, Algorythm: AES256 -> Ok -> password/confirm: test@123 -> Create disk

Step 3: Conceal a File in the Encrypted Disk

Create a file on Desktop (Test.txt) -> Insert some text -> Copy and paste in encrypted disk -> switch to Rohos disk Encryption -> Disconnect

Step 4: Mount the Disk again

Launch Rohos Disk Encryption -> Connect disk -> Enter password -> Ok -> Browse (explore the disk content)






5. Perform cryptanalysis using various cryptanalysis tools


a. Perform cryptanalysis using CrypTool

Step 1: Encrypt File with RC2

Search -> CrypTool -> Open -> Don't show again: close -> close the startingexample-en.txt window -> File -> New -> Insert some texts -> Encrypt/Decrypt -> Symmetric (modern) -> RC2 -> Key length: 8 bits -> Hexadecimal xter: 05 -> Encrypt 

PS: The chosen hexadecimal character acts as a key that you must send to the intended user along with the encrypted file.

Step 2: Save and Share File

File -> Save -> Location: Desktop -> Save-> Copy and paste in Share Drive. 

Step 3: Decrypt File (.19)

navigate to shred file -> copy and paste on Desktop -> Search -> CrypTool -> File -> Open -> Navigate to file in desktop -> File Type: All files -> Open -> Encrypt/Decrypt -> Symmetric (modern) -> RC2 -> Key length: 8bits -> Hexadecimal Xter: 05 -> Decrypt 


Repeat same process for Triple DES Encryption
Key Length: 128 bits (effectively 112 bits)
Hexadecimal Character: combination of 12





b. Perform cryptanalysis using AlphaPeeler

Step 1: Encrypt File With DES  (.11)

Create a file 'Test'on Desktop 
Search -> AlphaPeeler -> Open -> Professional Crypto -> DES Crypto -> Plain text file: Navigate to 'Test' -> open -> Cypher text file : Navigate to network share (where you want to save file) -> Confidential.txt (name of encrypted file) -> Open -> Pass phrase: test@123 -> Encrypt (DES-EDE (CBC)

Step 2: Decrypt File (.19)

Search -> AlphaPeeler -> Open -> File -> Open -> navigate to share/Confidential.txt -> Open (text is encrypted)
Professional crypto -> DES crypto -> Plain text file (choose where to decrypt file and new file name) -> Desktop/Result.txt -> Open -> Cypher text file (navigate to Share/Confidential.txt) -> open -> Pass phrase: test@123 -> Decrypt: DES-EDE (CBC)
